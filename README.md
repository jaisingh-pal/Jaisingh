## Projects
### 2D Simulation of HeteroSructure Bipolar Transistor (HBT)

1. Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor (HBT): HBT is a type of bipolar junction transistor (BJT) that incorporates heterojunctions – interfaces between different semiconductor materials – in its structure.
It is widely used in high-frequency and high-speed applications due to its superior performance compared to traditional BJTs.

2. 2D Structure in TCAD: In TCAD simulations, the 2D structure of an HBT is represented using a graphical interface to model the physical layout and material composition.
The simulation involves creating layers that represent the different semiconductor materials and their properties, including bandgap energies and carrier mobilities.

3. Emitter-Base-Heterojunction: The core of the 2D structure involves the emitter, base, and collector regions, with particular attention to the heterojunctions formed at the emitter-base and base-collector interfaces.

4. The heterojunctions play a critical role in enhancing the transistor's performance by facilitating efficient electron or hole injection across the junctions.
